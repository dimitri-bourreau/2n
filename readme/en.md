## Game

This project is inspired by the psychotechnical tests to be performed to become a pilot at Air France.

The fabulous site [Pilotest](https://pilotest.com) has developed excellent tests of this nature, must see!

This game uses these technologies: React.js, TypeScript, Reach Router, Shards React, react-i18next.
